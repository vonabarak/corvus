# Corvus Agent Guide

QEMU/KVM virtual machine management daemon with a CLI client, written in Haskell.

This file is the repository-level guidance for coding agents. Keep it focused on
durable repo facts, commands, conventions, and review expectations. Prefer
tool-neutral wording so Codex and other coding agents can use the same source of
truth.

## Architecture

### Executables

- **`corvus`** — daemon that manages VM lifecycle, listens on TCP or Unix socket
- **`crv`** — CLI client that communicates with the daemon via Cap'n Proto RPC

### Communication

Cap'n Proto RPC over TCP or Unix socket. The wire schema is the source of truth and
lives under [`schema/`](schema/) (regenerate Haskell bindings with `make capnp`).
The daemon's bootstrap cap is `Daemon` (`schema/corvus.capnp`); every subsystem
hangs off it as a manager → resource cap hierarchy. Streaming flows (serial
console, HMP monitor, build events, guest-agent status, task progress) use the
sink caps in `schema/streams.capnp`. See [`doc/rpc-protocol.md`](doc/rpc-protocol.md)
for a full tour and a pycapnp client example.

`src/Corvus/Protocol.hs` and `src/Corvus/Protocol/*.hs` retain the **internal** DTOs
(VmInfo, DiskImageInfo, …) that handlers return and that the Wire layer converts
into the Cap'n Proto structs in `Capnp.Gen.*`.

```

The privileged network agent lives under `src/Corvus/Netd/` and ships
as the separate `corvus-netd` executable in `app/netd/`. The daemon
talks to it over Cap'n Proto using the client shim in
`src/Corvus/NetAgentClient.hs` (helpers in `NetAgentClient/Spec.hs`).

### Key Patterns

- **Concurrency**: STM (`TVar`) for shared server state; `async` for background VM process monitoring
- **Database**: Persistent + Esqueleto ORM with PostgreSQL; `runSqlPool` pattern; auto-migration on startup
- **Logging**: `MonadLogger` (LoggingT transformer)
- **VM state machine**: Enforced in `Model.VmState.validateTransition` (pure, directly unit-testable) — stopped → starting (if guest agent) or running → stopping → stopped. VMs with guest agent go through `starting` state until first healthcheck ping succeeds. Reset always returns to stopped.
- **Task tracking**: Every mutating request is recorded in the `task` table via `withTask` wrapper in `Handlers.hs`. Read-only requests (list, show, ping) are skipped. Startup and shutdown are also recorded as tasks.
- **Networking via `corvus-netd`**: The daemon runs unprivileged. All privileged networking (bridge creation, TAP allocation, nftables, dnsmasq supervision) is delegated to a system-wide `corvus-netd` agent that runs as root and listens on `0.0.0.0:9877` by default; mTLS gates who can speak to it. The daemon expresses intent declaratively via `applyNetwork` / `applyTap`; the agent reconciles kernel state and is stateless across restarts (resources are tagged `corvus-br*` / `corvus-tap*` / `corvus_fw`; the agent's startup and shutdown cleanup passes match those prefixes). Bridges and TAPs live in the host root netns — libvirt-style — so `tcpdump`, `ss`, `ip link` from the host all see them.

### Database Entities

`Vm`, `DiskImage`, `Drive`, `Network`, `NetworkInterface`, `SharedDir`, `Snapshot`, `SshKey`, `VmSshKey`, `TemplateVm`, `TemplateDrive`, `TemplateNetworkInterface`, `TemplateSshKey`, `CloudInit`, `TemplateCloudInit`, `Task` — all defined in `Model.hs`.

### Key Enums (text-serializable via `EnumText` typeclass)

`VmStatus` (stopped/starting/running/stopping/paused/error), `DriveInterface`, `DriveFormat`, `DriveMedia`, `CacheType`, `NetInterfaceType` (user/tap/bridge/macvtap/managed), `SharedDirCache`, `TemplateCloneStrategy` (clone/overlay/direct/create), `TaskSubsystem` (vm/disk/network/ssh-key/template/shared-dir/snapshot/system/apply), `TaskResult` (running/success/error).

### Test Structure

```
test/
├── Spec.hs              # hspec-discover entry point
├── Test/
│   ├── Prelude.hs       # Re-exports, test utilities
│   ├── Database.hs      # Test database setup/teardown
│   ├── Settings.hs      # Test configuration
│   └── DSL/
│       ├── Core.hs      # TestM monad, testCase, runDb
│       ├── Given.hs     # Setup primitives (insert VMs, disks, keys, etc.)
│       ├── When.hs      # Action primitives (RPC calls via daemon)
│       └── Then.hs      # Assertion primitives
└── Corvus/
    └── *Spec.hs         # Unit tests (Hspec, no QEMU / no daemon process)
```

Integration tests live in `integration_tests/` (pytest); `test/` is
Haskell unit tests only. Tests use a custom BDD DSL (`Test.DSL.*`)
with `testCase`, `given`, `when_`, `then_`.

## Build System

Stack + Hpack (`package.yaml` → `corvus.cabal`), LTS-23.28 resolver.

### Make Targets

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Stack build |
| `make install` | Install binaries to `~/.local/bin/` + shell completions + pipx-install corvus-admin. Run `corvus-admin quickstart` after for a turn-key single-node setup. |
| `make format` | Ruff (Python) + Fourmolu (Haskell) formatting, in-place. Also runs frontend formatting when `frontend/node_modules/` exists. |
| `make lint` | Read-only checks: HLint, Fourmolu `--check`, Ruff check, Ruff format check, mypy. Also runs frontend lint/format checks when `frontend/node_modules/` exists. |
| `make unit-tests` | Haskell unit tests (the full Haskell suite — no integration tests left here) |
| `make integration-tests` | Pytest integration suite under `integration_tests/`; accepts `MATCH=<pytest -k expr>` |
| `make python-test` | Python client/admin pytest suites against a daemon on a temp Unix socket |
| `make test` | Umbrella target: `unit-tests`, `python-test`, then `integration-tests` |
| `make set-version VERSION=X.Y.Z.W` | Bump the project version in lockstep across `package.yaml`, `corvus.cabal`, and `pyproject.toml`. Use this whenever the user says "bump version" / "set version" / "release X.Y.Z.W" — do NOT hand-edit those files. |
| `make release` | Stage a self-contained release tree under `release/` and tarball it (4 binaries, completions, Python wheel + sdist, doc, yaml, schema). Same recipe the GitHub Release workflow runs; use it for a local dry-run before tagging. |

### Build Dependencies

No external C libraries required.

### Integration Test Notes

- Integration tests require QEMU/KVM access.
- Networking tests drive a `corvus-netd` instance (the privileged agent), which needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN`; the netd smoke test launches it via `systemd-run` on the test node and tunnels Cap'n Proto over SSH so the pytest process itself stays unprivileged.
- Log level during tests is controlled by `CORVUS_TEST_LOG_LEVEL` env var (default: `info`). Use `CORVUS_TEST_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for verbose output.

### Integration test scheduling

The custom xdist scheduler in [`integration_tests/conftest.py`](integration_tests/conftest.py) (`_LoadScopeShutdownSingleton`) enforces two invariants every new test must respect:

1. **Class atomicity.** Every test method in a class runs on the same worker. The class-scoped `topology` fixture in `IntegrationTestCase` boots one outer test-node VM per class and relies on this. Design tests so that all state shared across methods of a class is held by the class fixture; never assume coordination between methods on different workers.

2. **On-demand scope dispatch.** A test class is assigned to a worker only when that worker is down to one pending test (the running one) — the absolute minimum lookahead xdist's worker design permits. A slow class does NOT accumulate a backlog of queued classes behind it on the same worker; idle workers pick up queued classes from the global queue first. Design tests so they don't depend on a specific cross-class execution order; the scheduler reorders fast/slow classes and dispatches opportunistically.

When writing a multi-minute test class, mark it `@pytest.mark.slow` so it floats to the head of the dispatch queue (see [`conftest.py`](integration_tests/conftest.py) `pytest_collection_modifyitems`) and starts at t=0 on its own worker.

## Project Rules

### Handler implementation

All mutating operations must be implemented as Action types (instances of the `Action` type class from `Corvus.Action`), not as plain `handle*` functions. Each Action is a data type carrying its parameters, with `actionExecute` containing the logic. The `handle*` functions are internal implementation details called only by their own Action instance — they should not be exported or called directly from other modules.

When one handler needs to invoke another handler's logic, it should use the other handler's Action type via `actionExecute`, `runAction`, or `runActionAsSubtask` — never by calling the `handle*` function directly.

Read-only operations (list, show, get) are the exception — they are dispatched directly in `Handlers.hs` without Action wrapping since they don't need task recording.

### After code changes

Run `make format` and `make lint` after modifying Haskell or Python source files. `make format` edits files in place. `make lint` is read-only and covers static analysis plus formatter `--check` passes, so run `make format` first and fix all lint warnings before committing.

When `frontend/node_modules/` exists, both targets also cover frontend formatting/linting. If it does not exist and the change touched frontend code, run the frontend-specific setup/checks needed for that work.

```
make format
make lint
```

### Before committing

Run `make test` before every commit unless the user explicitly asks for a narrower verification. It chains `unit-tests`, `python-test`, and `integration-tests` in escalating-cost order so cheap failures surface before slower phases. Make stops on the first non-zero exit, so a green `make test` is the local equivalent of the full local pre-merge gate.

```
make test
```

### Backwards compatibility

Corvus is in early beta. Breaking changes — to YAML schemas, the binary RPC protocol, the database schema, the CLI, and anything else — are accepted without compatibility shims, deprecation paths, or transitional warnings. When renaming a field or removing a feature, change every call site outright; do not keep the old name as an alias and do not add migration code that detects and rewrites legacy inputs. Make the break clean and update the docs and examples in the same commit.

### Cross-entity references

Every JSON / REST response field that refers to a *different* entity must use the nested `{id, name}` shape, never flat `<role>_id` (+ `<role>_name`) fields. Use the shared `NamedRef` type:

* **Cap'n Proto**: `Common.NamedRef` in [`schema/common.capnp`](schema/common.capnp).
* **Haskell**: `Corvus.Protocol.NamedRef` (record with `nrId`, `nrName`).
* **Python**: `corvus_client.types.NamedRef`.
* **TypeScript**: `NamedRef` in [`frontend/src/api/refs.ts`](frontend/src/api/refs.ts).

Optional references become `Maybe NamedRef` / `NamedRef | None` / `NamedRef | null`. On the wire the absence is encoded as `id == 0`; the language-level converters translate to the appropriate nullable type at the boundary so consumers never see the sentinel.

The field name on the container is the **role**, not the entity's name: a drive's reference to its image is `disk_image: NamedRef`, not `image` or `disk_image_ref`. When in doubt, mirror the foreign-key column name in the database (`drive.disk_image_id` → field `disk_image`).

Two narrow carve-outs:

* `TaskInfo.parent_id` stays flat (`Maybe Int64`) — tasks don't carry a human-readable name field, so there's nothing to nest.
* Input-side RPC lookups use `Common.EntityRef` (a separate `id`-OR-`name` union — see `Corvus.Wire.Common.EntityRef`). `NamedRef` is output-only.

Database-only references (FKs that never surface in CLI / REST output, e.g. internal task-tracking columns) are exempt — this rule only applies to fields a user can see.
